This code sets up an Express server to handle API requests.
First, it imports the necessary modules: express, cors, and mongoose.
Then, it imports the route handlers from the respective route files: userRoute, chatRoute, and messageRoute.
Next, it creates an instance of the Express application and assigns it to the app variable.
The dotenv module is used to load environment variables from a .env file.
The express.json() middleware is used to parse JSON data in the request body.
The cors() middleware is used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing requests from different origins.
The routes are mounted on different paths using the app.use() method. The userRoute is mounted on the "/api/users" path, the chatRoute on the "/api/chats" path, and the messageRoute on the "/api/messages" path.
The app.get() method defines a route handler for the root path ("/") that sends a "Welcome to Chat App APIs..." message as the response.
The app.listen() method starts the server and listens on the specified port. The port is set to 5000 or the value of the process.env.PORT environment variable.
The mongoose.connect() method is used to establish a connection to a MongoDB database. The connection URI is retrieved from the process.env.ATLAS_URI environment variable.
If the MongoDB connection is successful, it logs a success message to the console. If it fails, it logs an error message.
In summary, this code sets up an Express server with middleware for handling API requests. It defines routes for users, chats, and messages, and establishes a connection to a MongoDB database.
